/* ================================================================
   MJM NURSERY — WHERE THE AUDIT MODULE SENDS YOU TO SIGN IN

   Every audit page routes unauthenticated visitors to the 555 Auditor
   Portal (audit_index.html). It is a thin skin over the same Supabase
   Auth the main MJM AI login uses — the same email/password works, the
   same mjm_user object and sb-*-auth-token session land in localStorage
   — so signing in here is interchangeable with signing in at the root.
   Admin who wants the module hub still has the "Back to Portal" button
   on audit_admin.html to reach ../index.html.

   The auditor login used to redirect to ../index.html (MJM AI System)
   as its default, and only fell through to audit_index.html when the
   device was offline. That meant the field-facing "555 Auditor Portal"
   rebrand was never the door anyone actually saw — everyone landed on
   the generic system login. This build flips that: the audit portal is
   the primary door, and it works online and off the same way.

   Loaded in the <head>, above each page's own script, so a page nobody
   is entitled to redirects before it renders rather than flashing.

     stayed alive. Sign out of audit and you landed on the portal, which
     found a live session and showed the module hub: signed out of one
     module, still signed in to everything.

     Three things have to go, or the next page just lets you back in:

     was given the main nursery and nothing else. Guessing access from free
     text was the problem; both nurseries are offered now and the choice is
     the auditor's.

  /* ── OPENED FROM THE MANAGE PAGE ──
     A module page carries ?from=manage when audit_admin.html sent the
     person into it. It is not a permission — it says where they came
     from, and two things follow from that.

     The first is that they asked for the module, not for the To Do
     list. Three of the four modules bounce a visitor with no ?plot=
     straight back to audit_home.html, on the reasoning that the
     auditor's way in is a pending-plot chip and a bare plot grid is
     redundant. That reasoning is the phone's. Somebody who pressed
     "Plot Condition Audit" on the manage page asked for the module by
     name and got the auditor portal instead.

     The second is the nursery. The stored scope is a field auditor's
     working set — one nursery at a time, flipped with the Switch pill
     — and it is the right default for the phone. On the manage page it
     is not: what is on screen there is both nurseries at once, side by
     side, and stepping into a module from it should not silently drop
     half of that because of a switch made on a phone last week. From
     the manage page every nursery is in scope. */
