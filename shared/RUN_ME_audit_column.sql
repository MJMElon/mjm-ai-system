-- WORK MAINTENANCE LIST — the Audit column
--
-- Paste the whole file into the Supabase SQL Editor and press Run. It adds
-- one read-only policy and changes no table, no data and nobodys ability to
-- write anything. Safe to run twice.
--
-- ── Why it is needed ──
--
-- Nursery Operation Management -> Work Maintenance List now carries an Audit
-- column showing the Auditor Portals verdict on each job: Satisfied,
-- Unsatisfied, or a dash where nobody has audited it.
--
-- Those verdicts live in audit_maintenance_audits, and that table is closed
-- to everybody except the audit module. So without this, the column renders
-- for everyone and stays empty for everyone - which looks exactly like
-- "nothing has been audited yet" and is not the same thing at all.
--
-- ── What it grants, and what it does not ──
--
-- SELECT only, to signed-in staff, on the audit tables verdicts. Filing,
-- changing and deleting an audit stay exactly where they are: the audit
-- module. A nursery manager can see that a job passed. They still cannot
-- pass one.
--
-- Customers are excluded - the rule below is false for them - so this does
-- not put audit results in front of anybody outside the company.
--
-- ── After running ──
--
-- The last statement prints one row per check. Every one should say OK.

-- ── 1. Who may read a verdict ───────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Its own function with its own name, deliberately. _mjm_is_staff() already
-- exists on databases where shared/migration_audit_rls_align.sql has been
-- run, and re-declaring it here would mean this file quietly redefining a
-- rule the audit module depends on. This one is only ever named by the one
-- policy below.
--
-- user_type is read through to_jsonb rather than named directly, because a
-- LANGUAGE sql body is checked the moment it is created: naming a column
-- that a database has not got yet fails the whole file rather than the one
-- line. Absent reads as system, which is a member of staff - the same
-- answer the rest of the system gives.

-- ── 2. The read ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Its own policy with its own name rather than an edit to the audit modules.
-- Two reasons: re-running the audit modules own migration will not quietly
-- undo this, and anybody reading the policy list can see at a glance that the
-- operation side reads these and does not write them.
--
-- RLS decides which rows; the GRANT decides whether the role may reach the
-- table at all. A missing GRANT raises 42501 too, with a different message,
-- so set both and remove the ambiguity.
