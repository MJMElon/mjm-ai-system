-- SITE BOUNDARY — one outline per nursery
--
-- Paste the whole file into the Supabase SQL Editor and press Run. It widens
-- one table from a single row to a row per nursery and replaces one read-only
-- function. No outline already uploaded is lost. Safe to run twice.
--
-- ── What changes ──
--
-- shared_site_boundary was built to hold ONE outline for the whole company -
-- id 1, and a CHECK that forbade a second row. The nurseries are separate
-- sites with a separate file each, and one shape drawn round all three is a
-- shape round nothing. So the table gets a `nursery` column, the CHECK goes,
-- and the nursery becomes what a row is filed under.
--
-- An outline already stored under id 1 belonged to no nursery in particular.
-- It is kept, filed under  - which every phone reads as "all of them" - so
-- running this cannot take a line off anybodys map. Upload the three files
-- and then Remove that one on the Boundary panel if it is no longer wanted.
--
-- ── What a phone sees ──
--
-- worker_site_boundary() now answers with a LIST, filtered to the nurseries
-- inside that workers own boundary: a worker confined to BNN gets BNNs
-- outline and not the other two. Not for secrecy - an estate outline is not a
-- secret - but because drawing three nurseries behind one walked path is
-- three-quarters noise on a phone in a plot, and the wrong one is worse than
-- none. A Field Conductor is an office account, reads the table directly, and
-- gets all of them.
--
-- ── After running ──
--
-- The last statement prints one row per check, then one per nursery. Upload
-- the files on System Setting -> Boundary, one nursery at a time.
