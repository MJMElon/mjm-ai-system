-- GIVE EVERY ACCOUNT A PROFILE ROW, AND STOP IT HAPPENING AGAIN
-- shared/RUN_ME_fix_missing_profiles.sql
--
-- Safe to run twice. It only ever ADDS a profile row for an account that has
-- none — no existing row is touched, no permission is changed, nothing is
-- deleted.
--
-- WHAT IS WRONG
--
-- Ten of the twenty-five newest signups have an account in auth.users and no
-- row in shared_profiles. The User Access page reads shared_profiles, so
-- those people are invisible there: they cannot be listed, and they cannot be
-- granted anything.
--
-- The two are joined by a trigger, on_auth_user_created → handle_new_user().
-- The timestamps say it is not running. On 1 Sep:
--
--     05:31:53  Manggi anak Bai   has a profile
--     05:35:31  akbarcahaya776    none
--     05:36:12  amrigajsj         none
--     05:39:34  laluaenalmashuri  none
--
-- Manggi is not the exception because the trigger worked for him — he signed
-- up through a page that writes the profile ITSELF after signUp(), the way
-- audit/audit_index.html does. Every account that still has a profile got it
-- from an app doing that. Every account that went through a page WITHOUT that
-- upsert has nothing. Which means the trigger has not been doing its job for
-- some time, and the apps have been quietly covering for it.
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES
--
--   1. Says whether the trigger is attached, before changing anything.
--   2. Creates the missing rows — id, email, full_name and user_type taken
--      from the signup itself. Exactly what the trigger would have written.
--   3. Rebuilds the trigger so future signups do not need this again.
--   4. Prints what is left, which should be nothing.
--
-- NO PERMISSIONS ARE WRITTEN. An empty permissions column means "nobody has
-- been asked"; filling it with todays defaults would turn an unasked
-- question into a decision. Everyone appears on User Access with no access,
-- and you grant what each of them needs from there.
