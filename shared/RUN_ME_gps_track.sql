-- GPS TRACK RECORD — everything, in one file
--
-- Paste the whole thing into the Supabase SQL Editor and run it once.
--
-- It does two jobs:
--   1. adds the columns a walked track needs
--   2. updates the four worker-portal functions that read or write them,
--      and the one that carries the function switches to the phone
--
-- Nothing is read, changed or removed. Safe to run more than once. This
-- replaces the three-column version handed over earlier today — do not run
-- that one.
--
-- Source of truth for all of this is the repository:
--   shared/add_maint_field_gps.sql
--   shared/create_worker_portal.sql
-- Running the whole of create_worker_portal.sql instead of this file does the
-- same thing; this is just the short way round.

-- ── 1. The columns ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
--   gps_track       the walk: [[lng, lat, t, acc], …]. LONGITUDE FIRST — the
--                   order GeoJSON and shared_site_boundary both use, and the
--                   easiest thing here to get backwards. `t` is seconds since
--                   the track started; `acc` is metres.
--   gps_points      how many fixes
--   gps_distance_m  how far was walked
--   gps_started_at  when start was pressed
--   gps_ended_at    when stop was pressed
--   gps_lat/lng     where the track STARTED, in their own columns, so "where
--   gps_accuracy    was this job" can be asked of five hundred rows without
--                   opening a JSON array each.
