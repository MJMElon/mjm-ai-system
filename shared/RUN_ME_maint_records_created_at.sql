   nops_maint_records — add created_at

   audit_supabase.jss sb.select() appends `order=created_at.desc` to every
   read by default, and only falls back to an unordered read after
   PostgREST rejects it. nops_maint_records has never had that column, so
   every single read of it — the office Work Maintenance schedule, the
   auditor To-Do lists maintenance row, the maintenance audit form — paid
   for one guaranteed-to-fail request before the real one went out.

   The client side of this is already fixed (the failure is now learned
   once and remembered), but the failed request itself is still wasted
   work on the database every time a browser has not learned it yet. Adding
   the column removes the failure entirely — the ordered read just
   succeeds.

   Safe to run twice: ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS.
