-- NURSERY OPS — the Setting page, one paste
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (project kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Safe to run twice; safe on a database that has already run some parts.
--
-- This is the six Setting-page migrations in dependency order, assembled
-- so there is ONE file to paste instead of six to run in the right order.
-- Every part guards itself: a part already applied does nothing, a part
-- whose table is missing says so and moves on. The originals stay in
-- shared/ for reading; run THIS.
--
-- What a good result looks like: the SELECT at the bottom prints one row
-- per check, every ok column true, and the Messages tab says what each
-- part did or skipped.

-- ════ 1. Setting tables (tray size, chemicals, fertilisers, RLS) ════
-- ================================================================
-- NURSERY OPS — what the Work Maintenance Setting page now holds
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (project kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Safe to re-run.
--
-- What changes
-- ------------
-- The Setting tab used to keep three things that are moving elsewhere —
-- piece rates to their own module, workers to the FC Portal, and a
-- hand-keyed plot list that had drifted out of step with shared_plots.
-- Those three tables are LEFT ALONE here; only the screen that edited them
-- goes. Nothing is dropped, so the Worker Record tab keeps reading exactly
-- what it read yesterday.
--
-- What it gains is four things the schedules and the dosage calculator
-- need somewhere to read from:
--
--   1. tray capacity, for the pre nursery, where a plot holds trays
--      rather than polybags;
--   2. a pest chemical list;
--   3. a disease chemical list;
--   4. a fertiliser list, with a dose for transplanting and a dose for
--      monthly manuring, because the same fertiliser is used at two
--      different rates.
--
-- Plot capacity itself needs no new table: nops_maint_plot_qty already
-- keys (nursery, plot) -> qty. What changes is where the plot NAMES come
-- from — shared_plots, which every other module already reads — instead of
-- nops_maint_custom_plots, which was a second place to key them in.
-- ================================================================


-- ── 1. Trays, for the pre nursery ───────────────────────────────
--
-- A pre nursery plot is counted in trays, and a tray holds a fixed number
-- of seedlings, so its capacity is trays x per_tray. Both live beside the
-- polybag figure rather than in a table of their own: same grain, same
-- key, and a plot has one capacity however it is counted.
--
-- Nullable on purpose. A main nursery plot has no trays, and 0 would read
-- as "no capacity" rather than "not how this one is counted".
--
-- Through EXECUTE: an ALTER naming a table that is not there fails at PARSE
-- time and takes the rest of this file with it, so a database that has not
-- run migration_nops_maintenance.sql yet would get none of the four new
-- things and no explanation. This way it gets the three that stand alone,
-- and is told what to run for the fourth.

-- ════ 2. Capacity moves onto Seedling Stock plot names ════
-- ================================================================
-- NURSERY OPS — plot capacity keyed the way Seedling Stock keys it
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (project kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Safe to re-run. Deletes nothing until you ask it to, in Part 4.
--
-- The problem
-- -----------
-- nops_maint_plot_qty was filled in from a plot list hardcoded in
-- plot_maintenance_script.js — PN, BNN, UNN1, UNN2 with their plots. Stock
-- Management keeps the real list in operation_nurseries + shared_plots, and
-- the two spellings had drifted: "UNN1" there is "UNN 1" here, plots like
-- B13-R exist in one and not the other, and the Setting page ended up
-- showing both sets as separate nurseries.
--
-- From now on the page reads Stock Management only. This file moves the
-- capacity figures onto those keys so nothing that was typed in is lost.
--
-- It works in four parts, and each one SAYS what it did:
--   1. what is there now
--   2. move rows whose nursery is the same name spelled differently
--   3. move rows whose plot name appears in exactly one stock nursery
--   4. report what is left over, and hand you the DELETE for it
--
-- Nothing is deleted automatically. What is left after parts 2 and 3 is
-- either a plot Stock Management has never heard of or one that is
-- genuinely ambiguous, and neither is something a script should decide.
-- ================================================================


-- Everything runs through EXECUTE. A statement naming shared_plots is
-- resolved when it is PARSED, so on a database without Stock Management the
-- whole file would abort before the first NOTICE explained why.

-- ════ 3. The chemical and fertiliser lists the system already had ════
-- ================================================================
-- NURSERY OPS — the chemical and fertiliser lists this system already has
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (project kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Run migration_nops_maint_settings.sql first — this fills its tables.
-- Safe to re-run: an entry already there is left exactly as it is.
--
-- Where these came from
-- ---------------------
-- They were not in the database at all. They were two hardcoded lists in
-- nursery_ops/plot_maintenance_script.js, which is why the Dosage Calculator
-- could offer them and the Setting page could not: CHEMICAL_CATEGORIES and
-- FERTILIZER_INFO. This file copies them in, unchanged, so the Setting page
-- starts with what the field already uses instead of an empty screen.
--
-- Two things to know before running it
-- ------------------------------------
-- 1. Only the Pest and Disease groups come across. The hardcoded list also
--    holds weedicides and stickers — Basta, Sentry, Ally, Monex, Acosta,
--    Widex, Bond, Activator — and the Setting page has no list for those.
--    They are NOT deleted; the Dosage Calculator still reads them from the
--    script exactly as before. They simply have nowhere in the new block to
--    live yet. Part 3 lists them so you can see what was left behind.
--
-- 2. Every fertiliser is seeded ticked for MONTHLY MANURING only, because
--    that is the work these doses were written for (Membaja). Nothing in the
--    old data says which are also used at transplanting, and guessing would
--    put a wrong rate in front of somebody mixing. Tick the transplanting
--    ones by hand in the Setting page after this runs.
-- ================================================================


-- ── 1. Pest and disease chemicals ───────────────────────────────

-- The dose is PER PUMP, which is what the hardcoded list held and what the

-- ════ 4. Coverage — what one pump of each chemical covers ════
-- ================================================================
-- NURSERY OPS — how many seedlings one pump of a chemical covers
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (project kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Run after migration_nops_maint_settings.sql. Safe to re-run.
--
-- Why this column exists
-- ---------------------
-- The Setting page was working out "per seedling" as dose / 800 for every
-- chemical. That is right for most of them and wrong for at least one.
--
-- plot_maintenance_script.js has always known this:
--
--     const COVERAGE_PER_PUMP = 800;
--     const CHEMICAL_COVERAGE = { Asir: 1 };
--     const coverage = CHEMICAL_COVERAGE[chemName] || COVERAGE_PER_PUMP;
--     const totalUnits = (seedlings / coverage) * dose;
--
-- Asir is dosed PER SEEDLING, not per pump — its coverage is 1. Dividing
-- its 5 gm by 800 as well made the Setting page show 0.0063 gm where the
-- Dosage Calculator uses 5. Two screens, two answers, from one figure.
--
-- So coverage stops being a hardcoded exception and becomes a column. Every
-- chemical carries the number of seedlings one pump of it covers; per
-- seedling is dose / coverage, and a chemical measured per seedling simply
-- has a coverage of 1. The Setting page reads it and shows it.
-- ================================================================

-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (project kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Run after migration_nops_chem_coverage.sql. Safe to re-run.
--
-- Three things
-- ------------
-- 1. A third kind. Weedicides and stickers are neither pest nor disease and
--    had nowhere to live, so migration_nops_seed_chem_fert.sql left eight of
--    them behind in the script. They come across here.
--
-- 2. Asir moves to it. Asir is dosed per seedling rather than per pump,
--    which is not how the rest of the Pest list works.
--
-- 3. 800 seedlings to a pump stops being a constant and becomes a setting.
--    A chemicals own coverage may now be NULL, meaning "whatever the
--    preset says" — so changing the preset later moves every chemical that
--    has not been given a figure of its own, which is the whole point of
--    presetting it. Asir keeps its 1, because that is not the standard
--    spray and never was.
