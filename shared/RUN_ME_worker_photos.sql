   PHOTOS — a face on a workers record, and pictures of the work

   Two things that both come down to a photograph, run together because they
   are one paste and neither is much on its own.

   ── 1. A photo OF the worker ──────────────────────────────────────────

   `mjmnpayroll_workers.photo_url` — one picture per person, shown on their
   chip on the Worker System board and on their record. Set two ways:

     · by the OFFICE, on the workers record. Signed in as `authenticated`,
       so the documents bucket already takes that upload and there is no
       storage rule to add for it;
     · by the WORKER, on the registration page, so a name arriving in
       "Waiting to be allocated" arrives with a face on it. That one is a
       PIN sign-in and needs the ticket below — see part 2.

   The column holds a link either way; the picture itself lives under
   worker_id_photos/ in the bucket.

   ── 2. Photos of the WORK, from a phone signed in with a PIN ──────────

   This half is the interesting one, and it is worth saying plainly why it
   took a migration rather than a checkbox.

   A worker holding a PIN is `anon`. The documents bucket takes uploads from
   `authenticated` only — quite deliberately, because the anon key is printed
   in the app bundle, so a rule that lets `anon` write to the bucket lets
   ANYBODY write to it. That is why the photos switch on the Worker Portal
   has been stored but not obeyed since it was added: honouring it needed a
   way for a worker to upload that does not hand the internet a writable
   bucket.

   This is that way. A TICKET:

     · the phone asks for one (worker_photo_ticket) and gets a random UUID,
       but only if its token is good AND the photos switch is on for it —
       the same three layers the office sets, checked in the database where
       an app that has been tampered with cannot argue;
     · the ticket is good for TEN MINUTES and for one folder —
       worker_photos/<ticket>/ — and for nothing else in the bucket;
     · the phone uploads into that folder, records the job, and then burns
       the ticket (worker_photo_done). In practice it lives for seconds.

   A ticket comes in two KINDS, and the difference matters:

     work  the pictures of a job. Behind the photos switch, and behind the
           Maintenance module, because that is what they belong to.
     id    the workers own face, from the registration page. NOT behind
           either — a worker who has just registered has every module
           switched off (that is what "waiting to be allocated" means), so
           asking the Maintenance switch about their passport photo would
           refuse every single one of them. It is behind a valid session and
           nothing else, and a session is only ever handed out by
           worker_signin or worker_signup.

   Note what registration does NOT do: open a door to the world. The photo
   goes up AFTER worker_signup has answered, using the session token it just
   returned. Nobody without a token can mint a ticket of either kind.

   So `anon` can write to the bucket, but only inside a folder somebody was
   handed thirty seconds ago on the strength of a valid session. It cannot
   read the ticket table, cannot mint a ticket without a token, and cannot
   touch anything else under documents/.

   What this does NOT defend against, said out loud: the ticket is part of
   the photos public URL, so anybody who sees that URL within the ten
   minutes could put another file in the same folder. That is why the phone
   burns the ticket as soon as it is done with it, and why the window is ten
   minutes and not sixty. Nobody outside the office sees these URLs.

   Safe to run twice. Nothing here drops data.
