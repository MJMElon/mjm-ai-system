-- THE SETTINGS DOOR ON THE 555 WORKER PORTAL
--
-- Paste the whole file into the Supabase SQL Editor and press Run. Safe to
-- run twice. It changes ONE workers row and reads nothing else.
--
-- ── Why Settings is not showing ──
--
-- It is off for every worker until somebody is given it, and the screen that
-- gives it out is itself behind Settings. So on a nursery where nobody has
-- ever been given it, nobody ever can be — the circle has to be broken once,
-- from here. After that every later change is made on the phone.
--
-- Maintenance shows because its default is ON. Settings default is OFF, on
-- purpose: it hands out access to other peoples rows, and a door like that
-- should be opened deliberately rather than by nobody having said anything.
--
-- ── How to use it ──
--
-- 1. Run it AS IS first. Nothing changes; the result lists every worker who
--    can sign in, and what each of them can open today.
-- 2. Put a name from that list on the `who :=` line below, and run it again.
--
-- The name is matched on the payroll registers full name, ignoring case and
-- outer spaces. A name that matches nobody changes nothing and says so.
