-- SIGN UP ON THE 555 WORKER PORTAL
--
-- Paste the whole file into the Supabase SQL Editor and press Run. Safe to
-- run twice. It adds one function, tightens one that already exists, and
-- changes no data.
--
-- ── What it does ──
--
-- A new worker can key their name and a PIN on the portals front door
-- instead of waiting for somebody in the office to add them. The row it makes
-- has no nursery and no section, so it lands in the Worker System boards
-- "Waiting to be allocated" strip until somebody drags it into a column.
--
-- ── The part that matters ──
--
-- This is a door open to anybody who knows the address, so a row it creates
-- must be worth NOTHING until the office has looked at it:
--
--   * an unallocated sign-up sees no plots and no modules. Not "the plots of
--     no nursery" — a worker with a blank nursery currently means EVERY
--     nursery, which is the right reading for somebody the office put there
--     and exactly the wrong one for somebody who typed their own name in.
--     That reading is kept for existing rows and refused only for rows this
--     function made, so nobody loses access they already had.
--   * fifteen unallocated sign-ups and the door shuts until the office
--     clears them. Somebody amusing themselves gets fifteen rows in a strip
--     that is already asking to be tidied, not fifteen thousand.
--   * a PIN already in use is refused, and counts against the same one-minute
--     throttle the sign-in uses, so the door cannot be used to find out which
--     PINs exist any faster than it can be used to guess one.
--
-- ── After running ──
--
-- The last statement prints one row per check. Then open the portal, tap
-- "New here?" on the PIN screen, and the name appears on Worker System.
-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

-- ── 1. Is this worker still waiting to be allocated? ────────────────────
--
-- True only for a row this sign-up function made that nobody has filed yet.
-- A row the office created with a blank nursery is NOT pending: that is the
-- office saying "everywhere", and it has meant that since before this file
-- existed.
--
-- `section` is read through to_jsonb because it is a column some databases
-- have and some do not, and naming it directly would make this function fail
-- to create on the ones that do not.
