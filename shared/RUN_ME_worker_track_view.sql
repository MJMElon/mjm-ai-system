-- LOOKING AT A FINISHED JOBS WALK
--
-- Paste the whole file into the Supabase SQL Editor and press Run. It adds
-- one read-only function and changes no data. Safe to run twice.
--
-- ── Why a function of its own ──
--
-- worker_maint_records deliberately does NOT return the walked track. It
-- hands a phone up to two thousand records, and a thousand-point walk on each
-- of them is tens of megabytes down a nurserys signal to draw a list that
-- only ever shows "820 m". The summary — how far, how many fixes, where it
-- started — is stored beside the track exactly so that query does not have to
-- carry it.
--
-- So the line is fetched one record at a time, when somebody opens that job
-- and asks to see it. This is that call.
--
-- ── What it will and will not answer ──
--
-- The same boundary as everything else: it joins through worker_plots, so a
-- worker is told about a walk on a plot they may work on and told nothing
-- about any other. A record with no track answers null, which the phone reads
-- as "this job was recorded without a walk" — not as a failure.
