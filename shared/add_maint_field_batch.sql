-- MJM Nursery — FC Scan Portal · Maintenance

-- Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor and press Run. Adds three
-- columns to a table that already exists; nothing is dropped, and
-- it is safe to run more than once.
--
-- Until this runs the portal still saves the job — the plot, the
-- work, the chemical, the remark — and tells the Field Conductor
-- that the batches could not be kept.

  -- a join table because it is a note of what was there on the day,
  -- not a live link — the plots contents move on afterwards.

  -- 2 = 8th-14th, 3 = 15th-21st, 4 = 22nd to month end. Stored rather
  -- than worked out from the date, so a job recorded a day late still
  -- counts against the week it was scheduled for.
