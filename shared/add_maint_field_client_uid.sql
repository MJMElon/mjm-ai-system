   ONE RECORD, HOWEVER MANY TIMES IT IS SENT

   The FC Scan Portal now keeps a work record on the phone when there is no
   signal and sends it when there is. That queue can be interrupted at the
   one moment that matters: after the server has written the row, but before
   the phone has been told and let go of it. The next attempt would then save
   the same mornings work twice.

   So the phone gives every queued record an id of its own before it is sent,
   and that id is unique here. A repeat is refused by the index, the portal
   reads the refusal as "already saved", and the queue lets go.

   NULL for anything saved with a signal — a record that never went through
   the queue has no id to give, and NULL does not collide with NULL in a
   unique index, so any number of them are fine.
