-- MAINTENANCE WORK — the record a Field Conductor sent back
--
-- shared/add_maint_field_verify.sql gave a record the two things it needed to
-- say it had been checked: verified_by and verified_at. This adds the other
-- answer. A conductor going through the mornings submissions can also say
-- "no, not like that" — and a record sent back is not the same as a record
-- nobody has looked at yet.
--
-- Run this whole file in the Supabase SQL Editor. It adds columns and nothing
-- else: no data is read, changed or removed, and it is safe to run twice.
--
-- ── The columns ──
--
--   rejected_at     when it was sent back. NULL means it was not.
--   rejected_by     the conductor who sent it back
--   reject_reason   why, in one short phrase — the Verify Hub offers a
--                   handful of them rather than a text box, because this is
--                   pressed on a tablet standing in a nursery and a reason
--                   nobody types is a reason nobody records.
--
-- ── What sending back MEANS ──
--
-- The row stays. Nothing is deleted, and the work may well have been done —
-- what is being said is that the RECORD of it is not accepted, so the plot
-- goes back on the list as still outstanding. The FC Portal stops counting a
-- rejected record towards the weeks ticks the moment this column exists, so
-- the job reappears in the weeks to-do for the worker to record again.
--
-- Which is why rejecting also clears verified_by/verified_at, and verifying
-- clears these three: a record is in exactly one of three states — waiting,
-- verified, sent back — and two of them being true at once is a record no
-- screen can read.
--
-- Who may press the button is decided on the FC Scan Portals User Access
-- screen (scan/scan_user_access.html → Schedule Maintenance Work → Verify
-- work done), not here. The columns just hold the answer.

-- The verify columns this sits beside, repeated from

-- The Verify Hubs own question: what is still waiting to be looked at. The
-- deck is the rows where neither answer has been given, which is a small
-- minority once a week is closed — so the index carries only those.

-- The phone does not call Postgres, it calls PostgREST, which answers from a
-- cached picture of the schema. Until that is rebuilt a column added here is
-- "Could not find the rejected_at column" to the app, which reads exactly
-- like this file never having been run.

-- ── What you should see ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- The SQL Editor shows only the LAST statements result, so this is one
-- query rather than two: the three columns proving the file ran, then a
-- line each for how the records stand.
--
--   column   rejected_at     timestamp with time zone
--   column   rejected_by     text
--   column   reject_reason   text
--   records  <n>             every maintenance record
--   verified <n>             signed off
--   sent back 0              none yet — this file has only just added it
--   awaiting <n>             what the Verify Hub will show
--
-- Three "column" rows means the deck can now send a record back. Fewer than
-- three means the ALTER did not take, and it is worth reading the error
-- above rather than opening the app.
