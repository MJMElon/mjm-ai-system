   THE COLUMNS operation_trays IS ALREADY BEING ASKED FOR

   The trays table has only id, created_at, nursery_name and tray_name. Two
   features have been written against columns that were never added, and
   both fail quietly rather than saying so:

     current_qty   The batch report adds premium-care and double-tone
                   seedlings to a trays count as they are transplanted in
                   (operation_batch_detail.html). The read errors, the error
                   goes to console.warn, and the loop moves on — so the
                   count has never been kept. Nothing was lost; it was
                   simply never recorded.

     gps_lat       Settings → Edit Tray writes a GPS pin on EVERY save. With
     gps_lng       the columns absent the whole update is rejected, so the
     gps_set_at    Update Tray button has not been able to save anything at
                   all — pin, rename or quantity.

   Adding them makes both work. Nothing is dropped, no data changes, and it
   is safe to run more than once.
