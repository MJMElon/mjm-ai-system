   HOW MANY HOLES A TRAY HAS

   Every pre-nursery tray was assumed to hold 2,560 — the number was written
   into operation_batch_detail.html as a constant. Trays are not all the same
   size, so it becomes a figure keyed in per tray in Settings.

   TOTAL vacant, not current: this is the trays capacity when it is empty.
   What is standing in it is worked out from the ledger — planted in, less
   transplanted and culled out — and the batch report shows

       current vacant = total vacant − what is in the tray

   so the figure here never needs touching as seedlings come and go.

   A tray left blank keeps the old 2,560, so nothing changes until a number
   is keyed in.

ALTER TABLE operation_trays
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS total_vacant INTEGER;

/* Carry over anything already keyed in.

   The Quantity field that briefly stood in Settings wrote to current_qty, and
   the figures put there were tray sizes — that is what the box was being used
   for. current_qty only came into existence a day before this, so nothing in
   it can be the batch reports accumulated seedling count; it is all typed by
   hand. Take it as the trays size rather than making it be keyed twice.

   Anything still without a size falls back to the 2,560 the system has been
   assuming, so the batch report reads exactly as it does today.

   Only fills blanks — a tray already given a size is left alone. */
