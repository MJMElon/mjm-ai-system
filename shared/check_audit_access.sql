-- ================================================================
-- WHO CAN USE THE AUDIT MODULE
-- Run in the Supabase SQL editor. Read-only — changes nothing.
--
-- Shows every login account and what it can actually do against the
-- audit_* tables, under BOTH gates:
--
--   old_gate  — modules.audit in (admin,normal)      [migration_rls_hardening]
--   new_gate  — user_type <> customer                  [migration_audit_rls_align]
--
-- Whichever gate is currently live is printed by the second query, so
-- read that one first to know which column is the real answer today.
