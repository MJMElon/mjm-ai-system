-- WHY IS THE PROJECT UNHEALTHY?
--
-- Run this whole file in the Supabase SQL Editor. It reads and changes
-- nothing, and it is safe to run while the project is struggling.
--
-- "Unhealthy" on the Supabase dashboard is a symptom, not a cause. It is
-- almost always one of five things, and this asks all five at once so the
-- answer is a line you can point at rather than a guess:
--
--   1. the disk is full or nearly
--   2. connections are exhausted — usually something holding them open
--   3. a query is running away
--   4. something is blocked behind a lock
--   5. the working set no longer fits in memory
--
-- ONE result set on purpose. The SQL Editor shows only the LAST statements
-- result, so a file of nine queries answers eight questions into the void.
--
-- Read the LOOK column first: ok, or a line beginning with >>> that needs
-- attention.
