-- WORKER SYSTEM — why will a worker not save?
--
-- Run this whole file. It changes nothing: it reports every column the Worker
-- System form writes and whether the table has it, then the PIN count, the
-- constraints and the RLS policies — so the answer is a name rather than a
-- guess.
--
-- ONE result set on purpose. The Supabase SQL Editor shows only the LAST
-- statements result, so a file of four queries answers three questions into
-- the void. Everything below is a single UNION ALL.
--
-- The form writes a section TWICE, into `section` and `nursery`, and a role
-- twice, into `role` and `job_title`. That is deliberate and not a mistake to
-- tidy up: `nursery` and `job_title` are the original columns and older
-- screens still read them, while `section` and `role` are what everything
-- written since uses. Renaming either of a pair would quietly change what an
-- old report shows.
