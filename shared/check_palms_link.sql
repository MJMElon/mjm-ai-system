-- IS THE PALMS PLOT-STATUS LINK IN PLACE?
--
-- Read-only. Nothing here creates, alters, updates or deletes anything — run
-- it as often as you like.
--
-- One question, answered in one table: can the FC phones and the office
-- PALMS board both read and write the same plot log, and is anything
-- actually in it?
--
--   fcportal_palms_plot_logs   the ONE store of plot status. The phones
--                              PALMS module writes it; the office boards
--                              Current Status dropdown writes it; the board,
--                              Life of Plot and the motion study all read it.
--   nops_plot_status_stages    the stage list both ends choose from. Kept on
--                              Life of Plot, read by the phone and by the
--                              office, so there is one vocabulary.
--   palms_has_access()         the row-level rule: an account may read and
--                              write the log if it holds the FC Portal
--                              module at any level, or manages users. It is
--                              the same test the board uses to decide
--                              whether to offer the dropdown, so what the
--                              screen shows and what the database allows
--                              cannot drift apart.
--
-- HOW TO RUN IT
--   Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor → paste the whole file → Run.
--
-- WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE
--   Every row READY, a non-zero "entries in the log", and "you may write"
--   saying yes. Then the office dropdown will save and the phones will see
--   it on their next sync.
--
--   Note that "you may write" answers for whoever is running this. The SQL
--   Editor runs as the service role, which passes everything — so that line
--   proves the FUNCTION works, not that your own staff login does. To test a
--   real account, open the board signed in as them: a plain-text Current
--   Status column where you expected a dropdown is that account failing this
--   same check.
