-- WHO CAN CHANGE A PLOTS STATUS FROM THE PALMS BOARD?
--
-- Read-only. Nothing here creates, alters, updates or deletes anything.
--
-- The Current Status column on nursery_ops_palms_board.html is a dropdown for
-- an account that may write the plot log, and plain text for one that may
-- not. One rule decides it, in two places that agree on purpose:
--
--   the page   CAN_UPDATE  = modules.scan is set and not none
--                          OR manage_users
--   the table  palms_has_access()  — the same test, as row-level security
--
-- They match deliberately. Offering a dropdown whose save the database would
-- refuse is worse than plain text, so the screen only offers what the policy
-- allows.
--
-- Which means a Nursery Operation admin who does NOT hold the FC Portal
-- module and does NOT manage users gets plain text. That is the usual reason
-- somebody asks where the dropdown went.
--
-- HOW TO RUN IT
--   Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor → paste the whole file → Run.
--
-- WHAT TO DO WITH THE ANSWER
--   For a person who should be able to correct a status, either give them the
--   FC Portal module (Setting → that person → Edit Access), or tick Manage
--   Users if that is what they are. Both are decisions about access, so
--   neither is made here.
