-- ================================================================
-- MJM — reconcile the Transfer Plot Record import
--
-- Run AFTER shared/apply_transfer_plot_records.sql, in the same session or
-- any later one — but BEFORE its section 6, because this needs the two
-- staging tables (tmp_transfer_import, tmp_transfer_batch) still to exist.
-- If you already dropped them, re-run sections 1 and 2 of that file first.
--
-- Read-only. Nothing here writes anything.
--
-- The totals came back 120 rows / 15,480 seedlings against a sheet of
-- 118 / 15,061. This tells you exactly which rows make up the difference.

-- 2. THE EXTRAS — transfer records in the system that are NOT on the sheet
--    This is the 120 − 118. Each of these was keyed in by hand at some point.
--    Look at each one and decide:
--      • a genuine movement the office sheet simply does not list  → leave it
--      • the same movement as a sheet row, recorded with a different plot,
--        quantity or batch                                          → it is a
--        duplicate, and the source plot is being deducted twice. Delete it
--        (section 4 below) rather than editing, since the sheets version is
--        already in place.
