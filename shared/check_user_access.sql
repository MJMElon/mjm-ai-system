-- WHAT DID SETTING ACTUALLY SAVE — AND HOW TO PUT IT BACK
--
-- Part 1 reads and changes nothing. Run it first.
-- Part 2 is an UNDO, commented out. Read it before you run it.
--
-- ── Where this data lives ──
--
-- There is no separate table and none is missing. Everything the Setting
-- screen writes goes into ONE column — shared_profiles.permissions — which is
-- a JSONB that has been there since the beginning. `scan_areas` and
-- `scan_area_nurseries` are keys inside that JSON, the same way `modules` and
-- `scan_actions` already were. Saving is a single-row UPDATE.
--
-- So if saving broke somebodys access, it is not a missing table: it is what
-- got written into that JSON. Part 1 shows exactly that, per person.
-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


-- ── PART 1 · who can get in, and what Setting wrote ─────────────────────
--
-- LOGIN itself is Supabase Auth and has nothing to do with this column — a
-- person can always sign in; what this decides is what they see afterwards.
-- So if nobody can LOG IN at all, the cause is not here.
--
-- Read the CAN GET IN column. Anybody showing LOCKED OUT has no module at
-- all and will land on an empty hub.

-- ── PART 2 · UNDO, if the five doors are the problem ────────────────────
--
-- This removes ONLY what the new Setting screen added. It does not touch
-- modules, manage_users, scan_actions or anything else, so nobodys real
-- access is changed — every door simply goes back to the rule that governed
-- it before, which is what an absent scan_areas already means.
--
-- Safe to run, and safe to run twice. Uncomment the two lines to use it.
--
-- UPDATE public.shared_profiles
--    SET permissions = (permissions - scan_areas) - scan_area_nurseries
--  WHERE permissions ?| array[scan_areas, scan_area_nurseries];
--
--
-- And for ONE person only, if it is just their row that went wrong — put
-- their name in:
--
-- UPDATE public.shared_profiles
--    SET permissions = (permissions - scan_areas) - scan_area_nurseries
--  WHERE full_name = PUT THE NAME HERE;
--
--
-- The emergency one: give somebody back Manage Users, when the person who
-- had it can no longer open Setting to grant it.
--
-- UPDATE public.shared_profiles
--    SET permissions = jsonb_set(COALESCE(permissions, {}::jsonb),
--                                {manage_users}, true::jsonb)
--  WHERE email = PUT THE EMAIL HERE;
