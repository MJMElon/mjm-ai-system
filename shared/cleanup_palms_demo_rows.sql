--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
--
-- A fresh install of the 555 FC Portal seeds itself with a made-up plot log so
-- there is something on screen before anybody has keyed a day in. Every seeded
-- entry is stamped recorded_by = Contoh and flagged demo on the device, and
-- sync.js refuses to send anything carrying that flag —
-- src/modules/palms/sync.js: `if (e.uid && !e.demo)`.
--
-- The flag was added to the app AFTER the first version that synced. Any
-- device that pushed before that carries its sample log on the server still,
-- which is why the Monitoring Board shows plots last updated by "Contoh":
-- that column is the real recorded_by, and for those rows the real answer is
-- "nobody — this was generated".
--
-- Nothing writes Contoh any more. This clears what is already there.
--
-- SAFE TO RE-RUN. Run the SELECT first and read it.
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (main project: kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).

-- ── 1. LOOK FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- What would go, and what is left afterwards. If the second count is 0 for a
-- plot you know has been keyed in for real, STOP and work out why before
-- deleting anything.

-- ── 2. DELETE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Only exactly Contoh. Not a LIKE, not case-insensitive: a real person
-- called something similar must not be caught by a tidy-up.

-- ── 3. AND ON THE PHONES ─────────────────────────────────────────
-- This clears the SERVER. A device that still holds its own sample log keeps
-- showing it locally — that copy is flagged and will not come back up, so it
-- is cosmetic, but the Field Conductor sees plots that are not real.
--
-- On each such device: PALMS → Settings → clear the sample data, or clear the
-- sites storage. The next sync then pulls the real log down.
