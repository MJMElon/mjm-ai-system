/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   PALMS — Plot Activity Log Monitoring System, on the server

   PALMS keeps everything on the device it was recorded on: localStorage,
   under palms_status_v8, palms_culling_v1, palms_auditor_requests_v1 and
   palms_settings_v1. Nothing has ever been written to the database.

   That is fine for one person on one phone and wrong for everything else:
   a request raised for the Site Auditor is only seen by whoever is holding
   THAT phone, the office cannot see a plots activity at all, and a lost
   or wiped phone takes its year of records with it.

   These are the tables that fix it. Prefix fcportal_palms_, the same way the
   maintenance module uses nops_maint_.

   ── READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING ──
   Creating them changes nothing on its own. The PALMS screens read and
   write localStorage directly and synchronously; pointing them at these
   tables is a separate piece of work on the app. Run this when that work
   is ready to go in, not before — empty tables are harmless but they are
   also useless.

   Safe to re-run: everything is IF NOT EXISTS, and no data is touched.

   entry rather than one blob per device, because two Field Conductors
   working different plots must not overwrite each others day.

   made with no signal and sent later cannot be saved twice. */
