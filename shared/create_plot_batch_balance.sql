   WHAT IS STANDING IN EACH PLOT — WORKED OUT IN THE DATABASE

   Today every app that needs "which batches are in plot B5" downloads the
   WHOLE inventory ledger and adds it up in the browser. The office reports
   do it, and so does the Maintenance form on a Field Conductor's phone —
   tens of thousands of rows crossing the network to produce about ten.

   This view does the adding up inside Postgres. The phone asks for one plot
   and gets back the handful of rows it actually needs.

   The arithmetic is deliberately identical to the movement report's, so the
   figures agree with what the office sees:

   The arithmetic is the Movement Report's Main Nursery rules, written out
   at the top of runLifeOfPlot() in operation_reports.html. Those rules and
   these must not drift — the phone offering a batch the report says is
   gone, or hiding one it says is there, is the whole failure mode:

     in    Seeds_Received, Planted, Transplanted,
           Transplanted_Premium, Transplanted_DoubleTone
     out   Damaged_Seeds, 1st_Culling
     out   3rd_Culling, BUT ONLY ONCE EVIDENCED — the report counts it only
           where the drone-map figure has been keyed (MapQty: in the
           remark), because until the plot has been flown the culled figure
           is a claim. One still waiting on its map leaves the batch
           standing on the report, so it leaves it standing here.
     --    2nd_Culling NEVER DEDUCTS. It is Tab 6's running snapshot of a
           batch working through the 3rd culling, not a loss on top of it,
           and the Movement Report gives it no column at all. Deducting it
           is what made U1's batch 252 read 4,191 where the report read
           4,201 — a difference of exactly its 2nd culling.
     both  Cull3_Transfer — one log, two sides: it ADDS to the plot named on
           the row and SUBTRACTS from the plot named in the remark
     in/out Stock_Calibration, approved ones only — the same
           "[APPROVED by <who> on <when>]" marker the report reads. Its
           quantity_change is already signed and is added as stored.
     out   delivery orders, but ONLY against a plot·batch the ledger already
           has. A D/O's plot and batch are typed by hand, and a mistyped
           "24D" must never conjure a row into existence.

   Safe to re-run: everything is CREATE OR REPLACE, and no data is changed.
   To undo, see the bottom of this file.
