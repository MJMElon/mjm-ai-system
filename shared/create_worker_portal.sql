-- 555 WORKER PORTAL — the database side
--
-- The worker portal is the second front door on scan.mjmnursery.com. A Field
-- Conductor signs in there with the e-mail account every MJM system shares;
-- a worker signs in with the PIN on their row of the Payroll register.
--
-- A PIN is not a Supabase login, so a worker has NO `authenticated` role and
-- cannot touch a single table directly — nops_maint_field_records is
-- "TO authenticated" and stays that way. Everything a worker does goes
-- through the functions below instead. They run as their owner
-- (SECURITY DEFINER), they are the only thing granted to `anon`, and every
-- one of them starts by turning a session token back into a worker. The
-- phone never sees a PIN, never sees another workers row, and cannot reach
-- a plot outside its boundary.
--
--   worker_signin(pin)                     → { token, worker, modules, boundary }
--   worker_whoami(token)                   → the same, or null once expired
--   worker_signout(token)
--   worker_plots(token)                    → the plots inside the boundary
--   worker_plot_batches(token)             → what is standing in them
--   worker_submit_maint(token, payload)    → record a job
--   worker_my_records(token, limit)        → this workers own recent jobs
--   worker_maint_records(token, limit)     → every record in the boundary
--   worker_schedules(token)                → the office plan for those nurseries
--   worker_maint_roster(token)             → the colleagues a job may be credited to
--   worker_site_boundary(token)            → the outlines for this workers nurseries
--   worker_roster(token)                   → Settings: every worker, no PINs
--   worker_set_portal(token, id, portal)   → Settings: save one workers access
--
-- Safe to run more than once.

-- ── 1. Per-worker portal settings ───────────────────────────────────────
--

-- it is read on every sign-in and written from one screen, and this way a
-- workers access cannot outlive the worker.

--     "modules":  { "maintenance": true, "settings": false },
--     "boundary": { "nurseries": ["BNN"], "plots": ["B1","B2"] }
--   }
--
-- Absent, or any key absent, means the default below — see worker_portal().

-- not lock a worker out for mistyping — it counts failures across the whole
-- system and shuts the door for a minute once they arrive faster than people

-- ── 8b. What the maintenance board needs ────────────────────────────────
--
-- The worker portal shows the same Maintenance board as the FC Portal: this
-- weeks outstanding plots, the months weeks, the ticks against each job.
-- That board counts WORK, not the worker — a plot sprayed by somebody else
-- this morning is done, and showing it as outstanding would have two workers
-- spray it twice.
--
-- So this returns every record inside the boundary, whoever recorded it,
-- while worker_my_records stays what it is: the workers own list. Neither
-- reaches past the boundary.
-- The return type gained verified_by/verified_at, and Postgres will not
-- REPLACE a function whose OUT columns changed. Dropped first so re-running
-- this file over an earlier install upgrades rather than erroring.

 *   worker_roster        behind the Settings module, for handing out access.
 *                        Every worker in the company, with their portal
 *                        settings and whether they have a PIN.
 *
 *   worker_maint_roster  behind the Maintenance modules `workers` switch,
 *                        for the tick list on a record form. NAMES ONLY, and
 *                        only inside this workers own boundary.
 *
 * It returns no PIN, no id anybody could act on, no portal settings — a name
 * and the nursery it belongs to, which is all the tick list draws. Somebody
 * who should not be handing out access must not get the roster screens
 * answer just because the tick list was switched on for them.
 *
 * The boundary is the same one every other function here uses, so a worker
 * confined to BNN is offered BNNs crew and nobody elses.
 *
 * Whether it is OFFERED at all is a switch, in three places, and this
 * function does not decide it: System Setting → Portal View & Function for
 * the company, and the workers own row in the Worker Portals Settings.
 * The app asks only when those say yes.
