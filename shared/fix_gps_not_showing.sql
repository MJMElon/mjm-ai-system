-- GPS TRACK RECORD IS TICKED, AND STILL NOT ON THE FORM
--
-- Part 1 reads and changes nothing. Part 2 is the fix.
--
-- ── The two things that stop it ──
--
-- 1. The company switch was never stored, because shared_portal_settings has
--    no `actions` column yet — RUN_ME_portal_switches.sql not run.
--
-- 2. The persons own row says gps=false, and their own answer OUTRANKS the
--    company switch by design: the master decides for the people nobody has
--    decided about, and does not overrule the ones somebody has.
--
--    Which would be right, except nobody decided it. Between about 03:40 and
--    07:20 this morning, merely OPENING somebodys row in Setting and pressing
--    Save wrote todays default for every function into their record — so GPS
--    was written as an explicit "no" that nobody chose. The screen stopped
--    doing that, but the rows it already wrote still say it, and an explicit
--    no is exactly what the company switch is not allowed to override.

-- ── PART 2 · the fix ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Removes the gps answer from anyone whose row carries an explicit false, so
-- the company switch decides for them again. It does NOT switch GPS on for
-- anybody: absent means "nobody has decided", and with the System Setting
-- tick off that still means off.
--
-- Safe, and safe to run twice. Uncomment to use.
--
-- UPDATE public.shared_profiles
--    SET permissions = jsonb_set(permissions, {scan_actions,maintenance},
--          (permissions #> {scan_actions,maintenance}) - gps)
--  WHERE permissions #>> {scan_actions,maintenance,gps} = false;
--
--
-- Or give it to ONE person outright, without touching System Setting:
--
-- UPDATE public.shared_profiles
--    SET permissions = jsonb_set(permissions, {scan_actions,maintenance,gps}, true::jsonb)
--  WHERE full_name = PUT THE NAME HERE;
