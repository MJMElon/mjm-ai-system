-- MJM Nursery — Payroll System
-- Worker System: say per worker who is a general worker
--
-- Paste the whole file into the Supabase SQL Editor and press Run.
--
-- Safe to run more than once. It adds ONE column to ONE table and
-- nothing else: no worker is deleted, no existing column is changed,
-- and nobodys name, section, role or status is touched.

-- ── Does this worker get a column on the Work Maintenance sheets? ─
--    true   yes, always — whatever their role says
--    false  no, never
--    NULL   not answered; the system works it out from the role
--
--    Left NULL for everyone, so nothing changes until somebody ticks
--    or unticks the box on a worker. Once set, that answer wins and
--    the role stops deciding — which is the point: a role nobody
--    anticipated ("Field Conductor") can no longer put the wrong
--    person on a tick sheet.
ALTER TABLE mjmnpayroll_workers
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS maint_general BOOLEAN;

-- ── Check ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--    Every worker in the four nursery sections with the answer they
--    now carry. "(from role)" means nobody has set it yet.
