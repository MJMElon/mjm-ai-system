-- MJM — key the office 3rd Culling record in as the DRONE MAP QTY
-- Source: 3rd_Culling.pdf (84 lines, 24,571 seedlings, batches 222-240,
--         17/12/2025 -> 19/07/2026)
--
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor, top to bottom. Sections 1-5 only READ and
-- report; nothing is written until section 6. Safe to re-run.
--
-- WHAT THIS WRITES
--   * the office figure into Map Qty on each plots 3rd Culling row, leaving
--     the 3rd Culled Qty as the reports own calculation
--   * one Review_Rejection row per batch whose Map Qty and 3rd Culled Qty do
--     not tally, which is what puts a batch in the "Amendment Needed" list
--
-- The page already treats these two disagreeing as something an admin has to
-- explain -- saving such a plot prompts for a reason. This import does not
-- write that reason, so the prompt still appears and the explanation is the
-- admins, not a guess made here.

-- 0. HELPERS
--    The page reads the D/O collection lines forgivingly -- "239." and " 239"
--    are both batch 239, "U15 (UPB PREMIER HYBRID)" is plot U15. Sales have
--    to be worked out the same way here or the 3rd Culled Qty this computes
--    will not be the one the page shows. Dropped again in section 9.
