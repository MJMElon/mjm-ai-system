-- ================================================================
-- NELOS — who may raise a case, and who may close one
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (project kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Safe to re-run.
--
-- What this adds
-- --------------
-- migration_nelos_case_tools.sql gave each handler three ticks:
-- may_solve, may_edit, may_delete. Two of the five things a person
-- actually does with a case had no tick of their own:
--
--   may_create — raise a new case
--   may_close  — close one that has been solved
--
-- Closing is the one that matters. Solving says "I did the work";
-- closing says "and it was done properly" — the second is somebody
-- elses judgement of the first, which is exactly why it wants its own
-- right rather than riding along with may_solve. Until now only a Nelos
-- admin could close, which made every foremans finished work wait on
-- one person.
--
-- Defaults are chosen so running this changes nobodys day:
--   may_create true  — anybody holding Nelos could already raise a case
--                      from the dock and every modules To-Do widget.
--   may_close  false — nobody but an admin could close before this, and
--                      quietly handing it out would be a surprise. Tick
--                      the people who should have it in User Setting.

-- nelos_my_rights() answers with the two new ticks as well
--
-- Same shape as before, two columns wider. Every line keeps the "holds
-- Nelos at all" test first: an absent handler row means "a Nelos holder
-- whose ticks were never set", not "anybody", so a default of true must
-- never reach somebody with no Nelos.
--
-- Callers that only read four columns keep working — a REST call to an
-- RPC takes the columns it asks for.
