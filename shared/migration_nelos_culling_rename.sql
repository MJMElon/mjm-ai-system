-- MJM AI POWERED SYSTEM — migration_nelos_culling_rename.sql
--
-- NELOS — the culling calculators two cases, renamed to say where they
-- came from.
--
--   Culling — Drone Flight   →  From Culling Calculator - Request Drone Flight
--   Culling — Final Check    →  From Culling Calculator - Request Final Check
--                               For Pokok Inang
--
-- WHY THIS IS NOT JUST A LABEL
--   A Nelos case carries its category BY VALUE, and nelos_routes matches on
--   that string. Rename it in one place and the rule stops firing: every
--   culling case then falls through to assigned_module := source_module and
--   lands back on the Field Conductors who raised it. So all three move
--   together — the categories, the routing rules, and the cases already
--   filed under the old names.
--
--   The fourth place is code:
--   Barcode_Counter/src/modules/palms/cullingActions.js writes these strings
--   when the calculator raises a case, and it has been changed in the same
--   commit. Deploy that build and run this file; either order is fine for a
--   few minutes, because Part 3 carries stragglers across and this file is
--   safe to re-run.
--
-- Also sets auto_condition on both, which is what puts them on the Automate
-- Cases page as things a system opens by itself.
--
-- Requires shared/migration_nelos_auto_conditions.sql (auto_condition).
-- Run AFTER shared/migration_nelos_culling_cases.sql, which creates them and
-- points them at the auditors in the first place.
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor (main project: kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Safe to re-run.
