-- MJM AI POWERED SYSTEM — migration_nelos_directory_staff.sql
--
-- NELOS — the Add-somebody search finds staff, not customers.
--
-- shared_profiles holds everybody with a login to anything: the people who
-- work here, and every Salesweb customer who has ever booked a collection.
-- nelos_directory() was returning all of them, so searching "ah" on User
-- Access offered a dozen customers nobody could ever give Nelos to.
--
-- The rest of the portal already draws this line. Every staff gate in the
-- database reads
--
--     COALESCE(user_type, system) <> customer
--
-- and the main portals own User Access screen lists exactly
-- (user_type || system) === system (shared/shared_module_access.js).
-- This makes nelos_directory() agree with them, so the two screens that
-- hand out access are looking at one list of people.
--
-- WHY COALESCE, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH
--   handle_new_user() defaults a missing user_type to system, so a NULL
--   means staff — that is why every gate coalesces rather than testing
--   equality. The signup pages stamp customer now, but any customer who
--   registered before that landed with the default and still reads as
--   staff. Those accounts will keep appearing here, as they do on every
--   other staff screen; the fix is the same backfill for all of them:
--
--     UPDATE shared_profiles SET user_type = customer
--      WHERE id IN (…the customer accounts…);
--
--   It is deliberately not run from here. Which old accounts are customers
--   is a question about the data, not about Nelos, and a migration should
--   not guess at it.
--
-- Requires the earlier nelos migrations — run migration_nelos_all.sql first.
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor (main project: kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Safe to re-run.
