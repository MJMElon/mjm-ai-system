-- NELOS — a photo on the SOLVE, separate from the photo on the case
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (project kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Safe to re-run.
--
-- Why a second column
-- -------------------
-- migration_nelos_case_tools.sql gave a case one picture, nelos_cases
-- .photo_url — the photo of the PROBLEM, attached by whoever raised it.
--
-- Solving a case from the floating to-do dock attaches a photo too, but
-- it is a different picture answering a different question: proof the
-- work was done. Writing it into photo_url would overwrite the evidence
-- the case was raised on, and the before/after pair is the whole value
-- of photographing either of them.
--
-- So: one column for the problem, one for the fix. Both land in the
-- same nelos-photos bucket, which case_tools already created and made
-- publicly readable — nothing about storage changes here.
--
-- The dock works without this column: it retries the save without the
-- photo if the column is missing, keeping the remark and the status
-- change. Run this and the photo starts sticking too.

-- never gets the chance to run and the whole file aborts on a database with
