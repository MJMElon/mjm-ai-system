-- ================================================================
-- NURSERY OPS — plot capacity keyed the way Seedling Stock keys it
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (project kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Safe to re-run. Deletes nothing until you ask it to, in Part 4.
--
-- The problem
-- -----------
-- nops_maint_plot_qty was filled in from a plot list hardcoded in
-- plot_maintenance_script.js — PN, BNN, UNN1, UNN2 with their plots. Stock
-- Management keeps the real list in operation_nurseries + shared_plots, and
-- the two spellings had drifted: "UNN1" there is "UNN 1" here, plots like
-- B13-R exist in one and not the other, and the Setting page ended up
-- showing both sets as separate nurseries.
--
-- From now on the page reads Stock Management only. This file moves the
-- capacity figures onto those keys so nothing that was typed in is lost.
--
-- It works in four parts, and each one SAYS what it did:
--   1. what is there now
--   2. move rows whose nursery is the same name spelled differently
--   3. move rows whose plot name appears in exactly one stock nursery
--   4. report what is left over, and hand you the DELETE for it
--
-- Nothing is deleted automatically. What is left after parts 2 and 3 is
-- either a plot Stock Management has never heard of or one that is
-- genuinely ambiguous, and neither is something a script should decide.
-- ================================================================


-- Everything runs through EXECUTE. A statement naming shared_plots is
-- resolved when it is PARSED, so on a database without Stock Management the
-- whole file would abort before the first NOTICE explained why.
