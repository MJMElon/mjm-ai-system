-- ================================================================
-- NURSERY OPS — how many seedlings one pump of a chemical covers
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (project kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Run after migration_nops_maint_settings.sql. Safe to re-run.
--
-- Why this column exists
-- ---------------------
-- The Setting page was working out "per seedling" as dose / 800 for every
-- chemical. That is right for most of them and wrong for at least one.
--
-- plot_maintenance_script.js has always known this:
--
--     const COVERAGE_PER_PUMP = 800;
--     const CHEMICAL_COVERAGE = { Asir: 1 };
--     const coverage = CHEMICAL_COVERAGE[chemName] || COVERAGE_PER_PUMP;
--     const totalUnits = (seedlings / coverage) * dose;
--
-- Asir is dosed PER SEEDLING, not per pump — its coverage is 1. Dividing
-- its 5 gm by 800 as well made the Setting page show 0.0063 gm where the
-- Dosage Calculator uses 5. Two screens, two answers, from one figure.
--
-- So coverage stops being a hardcoded exception and becomes a column. Every
-- chemical carries the number of seedlings one pump of it covers; per
-- seedling is dose / coverage, and a chemical measured per seedling simply
-- has a coverage of 1. The Setting page reads it and shows it.
