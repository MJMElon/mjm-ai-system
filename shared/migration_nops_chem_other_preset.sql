-- ================================================================
-- NURSERY OPS — an "Other" chemical list, and a coverage you can preset
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (project kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Run after migration_nops_chem_coverage.sql. Safe to re-run.
--
-- Three things
-- ------------
-- 1. A third kind. Weedicides and stickers are neither pest nor disease and
--    had nowhere to live, so migration_nops_seed_chem_fert.sql left eight of
--    them behind in the script. They come across here.
--
-- 2. Asir moves to it. Asir is dosed per seedling rather than per pump,
--    which is not how the rest of the Pest list works.
--
-- 3. 800 seedlings to a pump stops being a constant and becomes a setting.
--    A chemicals own coverage may now be NULL, meaning "whatever the
--    preset says" — so changing the preset later moves every chemical that
--    has not been given a figure of its own, which is the whole point of
--    presetting it. Asir keeps its 1, because that is not the standard
--    spray and never was.
