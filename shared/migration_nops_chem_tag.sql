-- NURSERY OPS — what an "Other" chemical is used for
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (project kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Run after migration_nops_chem_other_preset.sql. Safe to re-run.
--
-- Why a tag and not a fourth list
-- ------------------------------
-- The Setting page has three lists — Pest, Disease, Other — and that is the
-- right number to read. But the schedules do not offer "Other": the P & D
-- sheet has a STICKER dropdown, and the Interrow sheet has its own chemical
-- dropdown, and each of those has always shown a specific handful:
--
--     PD_STICKER_OPTIONS    = [Bond]
--     INTERROW_CHEM_OPTIONS = [Basta, Monex, Acosta]
--
-- Those lists are about to stop being hardcoded and start coming from this
-- table. Without something to narrow them, the sticker dropdown would offer
-- every Other chemical — Basta and Sentry among them — and a foreman one
-- mis-tap away from spraying weedkiller as a sticker. That is not a tidiness
-- problem, so the distinction is kept.
--
-- It is a tag rather than a kind because a chemical is still Other; this
-- only says which of the schedules dropdowns may show it. NULL means it
-- appears in the Other list on the Setting page and in no schedule dropdown,
-- which is true of the weedicides that have no dropdown of their own.
