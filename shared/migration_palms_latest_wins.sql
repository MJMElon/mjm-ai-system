-- THE HOLE THIS CLOSES
--
-- A Field Conductors day report closes whatever it leaves out — but the
-- phone could only close the entries it KNEW about when the report was
-- keyed. An open entry it had not pulled yet (one the office set, one a
-- seed loaded, one another phone pushed) sailed past the report and ran
-- forever. The office board then showed that older stage on top of — or
-- instead of — the one the Field Conductor had just recorded. "I updated it
-- from the FC portal and the office still shows the old data" is this hole.
--
-- THE RULE, stated once:
--
--   A unit is single LATEST day report rules on every open entry that
--   STARTED BEFORE the reports date. In the reports list — still running.
--   Not in it — it was already finished by then, and is closed at the
--   reports date.
--
--   * Strictly BEFORE: an entry starting ON the reports date is never
--     closed by it. An office correction made later the same day survives a
--     report keyed from a screen that had not seen it yet.
--   * Only the LATEST report rules. An old report replayed by an old phone
--     closes nothing, because a newer statement about that unit exists.
--
-- Enforced here, in the database, on every day report that arrives — so it
-- holds for phones still running an old build of the app. The phone applies
-- the same rule to its own copy on sync (Barcode_Counter:
-- src/modules/palms/sync.js, settleAgainstLatestReport — change one, change
-- the other). The office board needs nothing: its own status change already
-- closes what it replaces.
--
-- This file also settles the log AS IT STANDS, one time, so the board is
-- right the moment this is run rather than after every phone has synced.
--
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (main project: kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Safe to run twice: the trigger is replaced in place, and the settle step
-- closes an entry once — on a second run there is nothing left matching.
-- Needs: create_palms_tables.sql. Runs fine with or without
--        migration_palms_no_takebacks.sql (they guard different doors).
