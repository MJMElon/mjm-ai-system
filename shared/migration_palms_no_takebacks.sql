-- WHY STATUSES WERE "CHANGING BY THEMSELVES"
--
-- The phone app is built so a Field Conductors record can never be lost:
-- sync pushes every local entry the server has not got. That is right for a
-- phone that keyed records offline — and it is exactly wrong for a row the
-- office DELETED on purpose. The server kept no memory of the delete, so the
-- next phone to sync looked at its local copy, decided the server was
-- missing it, and politely put it back. Replace the log (the audit seed does
-- DELETE + INSERT) and within hours every phone in the field has resurrected
-- its own copy of the old log: statuses flip back, and "last update" shows a
-- Field Conductor and a date from before the replacement.
--
-- Two rules end this, both enforced HERE, in the database, so no phone —
-- including one still running an old build of the app — can break them:
--
--   1. TOMBSTONES. Deleting a plot-log row now leaves its client_uid in
--      fcportal_palms_tombstones (an AFTER DELETE trigger, so every delete
--      counts: the seed, a cleanup, a hand-run statement). An INSERT of a
--      tombstoned client_uid is silently skipped — the phones upsert
--      succeeds and changes nothing. Phones also READ this table on sync and
--      drop their dead local copies, so their own boards come clean.
--
--   2. NO REOPENING. An UPDATE that would turn a closed entry (end_date set)
--      back into a running one (end_date NULL) keeps the close. That is a
--      stale phone pushing the copy it held from before the office closed
--      the stage — the offices close is the record.
--
-- To deliberately restore a deleted row: remove its tombstone first, then
-- insert. (DELETE FROM fcportal_palms_tombstones WHERE client_uid = …;)
--
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (main project: kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Safe to run twice. Nothing here deletes or changes any data.
