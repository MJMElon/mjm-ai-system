-- ============================================================================
-- ANYONE WHO CAN OPEN A PALMS PAGE MAY SET A PLOTS STATUS
--
-- Safe to run twice. CREATE OR REPLACE throughout; no table is touched and no
-- data is moved.
--
-- WHAT CHANGES
--
-- palms_has_access() decides two things at once, and they have to stay the
-- same thing:
--
--   • whether an account may read and write fcportal_palms_plot_logs, as
--     row-level security on the table
--   • whether the office PALMS pages offer a status dropdown or plain text,
--     because the pages ask the same question in JavaScript
--
-- It used to answer yes only for the FC Portal module, or for somebody who
-- manages users. Which meant a Nursery Operation admin — a person whose whole
-- job is that board — opened it, saw the status they knew was wrong, and had
-- no way to correct it. The pages are the record of plot status; the people
-- who keep them should be able to keep them.
--
-- So it now answers yes for the Nursery Operation module too, at any level.
-- That is exactly the test both PALMS pages already use to let somebody
-- through the door (canAccess(nursery_ops)), so the rule becomes: if you
-- can open the page, you can set a status.
--
-- WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE
--
--   • palms_is_admin() — DELETING a plot log still needs the FC Portal at
--     admin, or manage users. Correcting a status appends to the log; it
--     never removes anything, so the two are different questions and stay
--     different answers.
--   • Nobody outside those three modules gains anything. An audit-only or
--     sales-only account still cannot read the plot log at all.
--
-- WHAT TO RUN AFTER
--   Nothing. The pages were deployed alongside this and already ask the wider
--   question; until this runs they will offer the dropdown to an ops admin
--   whose save the database then refuses. Run it in the same sitting.
--
-- WHAT A GOOD RESULT LOOKS LIKE
--   The check at the end prints one row per staff account that can reach the
--   PALMS pages, and every one of them should say "may set a status". Anyone
--   still saying "cannot" holds none of the three modules and could not open
--   the page either.
