-- A colour per work status, for the Plot Status Map
-- shared/migration_palms_stage_colours.sql
--
-- Adds nops_plot_status_stages.color and seeds it, so the map can paint each
-- plot by the stage it is on rather than only by late / on schedule.
-- Editable afterwards on PALMS → Settings → Ideal Work.
--
-- WHY FIVE COLOURS AND NOT ELEVEN
--
-- Eleven fills that are all reliably tellable apart do not exist. Measured
-- against the usual accessibility gates -- on a map any two plots can sit
-- side by side, so every PAIR has to separate, not just neighbours in a list
-- -- eleven shades of one hue leave neighbouring stages at DeltaE 4.2, and
-- four hues in three shades each put pale blue against pale violet at 5.1.
-- Both read as the same colour to a person.
--
-- So stages SHARE a colour, in groups, and the key beside the map names the
-- stages under each one. The board merges stages with the same hex into a
-- single key entry by itself, so grouping is just "give these three the same
-- colour" -- no phase has to be defined anywhere.
--
-- These five are the offices own choice. They validate with all pairs in
-- play on a light surface: worst normal-vision DeltaE 16.3, all inside the
-- lightness band and over the chroma floor. Red against green is the one
-- soft pair for a colourblind reader at DeltaE 7.2, allowed only with a
-- second encoding -- every plot carries its name, the key spells out its
-- stages, and the table under the map gives the exact stage. A SIXTH colour
-- cannot be added without re-checking that it separates from these five.
--
-- Safe to re-run: only fills a colour that is still NULL, so an office that
-- has since changed one in Settings keeps its change.
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (main project: kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
