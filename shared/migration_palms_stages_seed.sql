-- ============================================================================
-- MJM AI POWERED SYSTEM — migration_palms_stages_seed.sql
--
-- Seed the plot status stages with the eleven PALMS was born with.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
--
-- Which plots exist and which statuses a Field Conductor can choose were
-- constants inside the FC Portal: 52 plot names and eleven activities, in
-- src/modules/palms/data.js. Adding a plot or renaming a stage meant editing
-- the app and deploying it — the wrong shape for something the nursery
-- changes and the office owns.
--
-- Both already existed on the office side, and neither was being read:
--
--   plots     shared_plots, kept in Seedling Stock Management
--   statuses  nops_plot_status_stages, kept on Nursery Operation Management
--             → Life of Plot → 🚦 Status Stages
--
-- The portal now reads both. This file makes sure the stage table says what
-- the app has always said, so the day it starts reading it, nothing changes
-- meaning. Without it, a nursery whose stage table is empty keeps running on
-- the built-in list (harmless), and one whose table holds a few unrelated
-- stages from an earlier experiment would suddenly offer those instead.
--
-- THE ORDER IS THE MEANING
--
-- A stages sort_order is the number the plot log stores against every
-- entry (act_n). Stage 1 is Saringan Anak Bibit and stage 11 is Pengambilan
-- because that is the order the work happens in. Renaming a stage is free.
-- ADDING one at the end is free. REORDERING or INSERTING in the middle
-- re-reads all past entries against the new order, so do that only when the
-- work itself has genuinely changed.
--
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor (main project: kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Safe to re-run: matches on name, updates the order and ideal days, and
-- never touches a stage the office has added itself.
