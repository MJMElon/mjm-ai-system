-- ============================================================================
-- MJM AI POWERED SYSTEM — nelos_trial_case.sql
--
-- ONE TRIAL CASE FOR THE NELOS LIST.
--
-- Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor and run. NLS-TRIAL then appears on the
-- Nelos dashboard with every column filled in: Pending and overdue, routed
-- to a system with a PIC, a category, a batch and a plot, and a photo — so
-- Status, System & PIC, Case Details and all four buttons have something to
-- show.
--
-- The photo is a drawing carried in the row itself, so this needs no storage
-- bucket and no upload. A real case gets a real photo through the Photo box
-- on Raise a Case.
--
-- Re-running replaces it rather than adding a second. When you are done:
--
--     DELETE FROM nelos_cases WHERE case_no = NLS-TRIAL;
--
-- or press Delete on the row, which is one of the things worth trying.
--
-- Needs migration_nelos_all.sql to have been run (all 10 parts — the photo
-- column arrives in part 10).
