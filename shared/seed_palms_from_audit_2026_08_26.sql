-- Load the PALMS log from the audit dashboard of 26-Aug-2026
-- shared/seed_palms_from_audit_2026_08_26.sql
--
-- Replaces every PALMS plot log with the 52 plots on that report, so the
-- Plot Status Map, the table under it and the Plot Motion Study all show the
-- real nursery instead of whatever is in there now.
--
-- ⚠ THIS DELETES THE EXISTING PALMS LOG. That is what "replace" means, and
--   it is what makes this useful for testing — but if any real field entry
--   has been keyed in since the last export, it goes too. There is a backup
--   step below that copies the current log aside first; do not skip it.
--
-- HOW THE DATES ARE WORKED OUT
--
-- The report gives the ACTIVITY and its ESTIMATED END DATE. A PALMS entry
-- stores the start, and the board works the end date back out as
-- start + the stages ideal days. So the start is simply:
--
--     start_date = estimated end date − that stages ideal_days
--
-- and the board then recomputes exactly the end date on the report. It is
-- read from YOUR stage table, not hardcoded here, so if Membesar is 270 days
-- for you the sums use 270.
--
-- Checked against the report before writing this: B1 Maturing, end
-- 18 May 2027, 270 ideal → start 21 Aug 2026, and 18 May 2027 − 26 Aug 2026
-- is 265 days, which is the "265" the report prints. B4 Collecting, end
-- 16 Aug 2026, 30 ideal → start 17 Jul 2026, 10 days overdue. Both agree.
--
-- Every entry is left OPEN (end_date NULL), because every one of these plots
-- is on that activity right now. There is no history — this is a snapshot,
-- not a rebuild of the past — so the Motion Study will have nothing to
-- measure until stages start finishing.
--
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (main project: kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Needs: create_palms_tables.sql, migration_palms_rls.sql and
--        migration_palms_stages_seed.sql already run. Run
--        migration_palms_no_takebacks.sql FIRST, or the plots this file
--        deletes will be resurrected by the first phone that syncs.
