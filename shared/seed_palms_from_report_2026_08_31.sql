-- ============================================================================
-- Load the PALMS log from the plot status report of 31-Aug-2026
-- shared/seed_palms_from_report_2026_08_31.sql
--
-- Replaces every PALMS plot log with the 52 plots on that report, so the Plot
-- Status Map, the table under it, Life of Plot and the Motion Study all show
-- one activity per plot with the end date you actually expect.
--
-- ⚠ THIS DELETES THE EXISTING PALMS LOG — including any status you have
--   corrected by hand on the board since the last load, and any entry a Field
--   Conductor has keyed in. Step 0 backs the whole log up first and step 3
--   PRINTS every plot whose current stage disagrees with the report, so you
--   can see what is about to be overwritten before you commit to it. Read
--   step 3 before running the rest.
--
-- WHY YOU WANT THIS
--
-- The board was showing most plots on two or three activities at once —
-- "Culling + Membersih + Meracun secara selingan" — because the log had
-- picked up duplicate OPEN entries. This puts every plot back to exactly one
-- open entry, which is what makes the status column readable again.
--
-- HOW THE DATES ARE WORKED OUT
--
-- The report gives the ACTIVITY and its ESTIMATED END DATE. A PALMS entry
-- stores the start, and the board works the end date back out as
-- start + the stages ideal days. So the start is simply:
--
--     start_date = estimated end date − that stages ideal_days
--
-- read from YOUR stage table, not hardcoded here. The board then recomputes
-- exactly the end date on your report.
--
-- WHAT CHANGED SINCE seed_palms_from_audit_2026_08_26.sql
--
--   U17  Pending cull, ends 25 Aug 2026   →  Soil transport, ends 03 Sep 2026
--   N3   Soil transport, ends 28 Aug 2026 →  Soil filling,   ends 03 Sep 2026
--   N15  Maturing, ends 22 Oct 2026       →  Collecting,     ends 24 Sep 2026
--   N16  Collecting, ends 24 Sep 2026     →  Collecting,     ends 26 Sep 2026
--
-- The other 48 plots are unchanged. If you ran the 26-Aug file and nothing
-- has moved since, those four are the only rows this alters — everything else
-- it does is clearing the duplicates.
--
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (main project: kibqjztozokohqmhqqqf).
-- Needs: create_palms_tables.sql, migration_palms_rls.sql and
--        migration_palms_stages_seed.sql already run.
