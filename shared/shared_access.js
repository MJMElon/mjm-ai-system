           So the row is created here, by the one client that CAN prove who
           they are: themselves. The self-insert policy allows exactly this
           — id = auth.uid() — and refuses anything else.

           an unasked question into a decision. They appear on User Access
           with no access, which is exactly right — the admin then grants
           it.

           Best effort, and silent. If the policy refuses, nothing is worse
