/* ================================================================
   MJM AI POWERED SYSTEM — NELOS FLOATING DOCK
   shared/shared_nelos_dock.js

   The round Nelos button that follows the user around the portal.

   Every page that loads this file gets a small floating circle with the
   number of cases waiting on THAT PERSON on it. Tap it and it expands
   into their To-Do list — overdue pinned at the top, then the rest,
   each row a link straight into nelos/nelos_case.html. Tap the minus
   and it shrinks back to the circle.

   It is deliberately ONE list, not a set of tabs: overdue first and
   pinned there, then what has my name on it, then the rest of my home
   module's queue. Every case, every status and every filter live one
   tap away on "Open Nelos →" — the dock is a reminder, not a second
   dashboard.

   "Raise a Case" opens a short form INSIDE the panel and writes the
   case from there. Somebody notices something wrong halfway through a
   delivery note or an audit; sending them to another page to report it
   loses their work, and usually the thought with it. The case records
   the page it was raised from, so whoever picks it up lands where it
   was seen.

   The circle can be dragged anywhere on the screen and the panel can be
   dragged bigger by its corner grip. Where it sits, how big it is and
   whether it was left open all live in localStorage, so it stays put as
   the user moves from Stock to Audit to Payroll.

   Usage — one line, anywhere in the page, no markup and no init call:

     <script src="../shared/shared_nelos_dock.js"></script>     (module page)
     <script src="shared/shared_nelos_dock.js"></script>        (portal root)

   Optional attributes on that same tag:

     data-source="operation"   only cases raised by one module, and the
                               module stamped on cases raised from here
                               (otherwise taken from the page's folder)
     data-hide-on="/mobile/"   extra path fragment to stay off

   WHY THIS DOES NOT USE shared_nelos.js
   -------------------------------------
   shared_nelos.js needs a Supabase client, and the pages this dock has
   to live on build theirs in five different ways (operation/* make one
   from SUPABASE_URL, audit/* have audit_supabase.js, some pages have
   none at all). Rather than guess at the host page's client — or make a
   second GoTrue client and fight it for the auth lock — the dock reads
   the signed-in session out of localStorage and talks to PostgREST
   directly. That is the same trick audit/audit_supabase.js already uses,
   and it means this file can be dropped onto ANY page in the portal
   without caring what else that page loaded.

   WHO SEES WHAT
   -------------
   The dock obeys the same visibility rule as MJMNelos.pending(): a
   person is pinned on nelos/nelos_user_setting.html to a home system and
   numbered inside it, and sees that system's queue plus anything assigned
   to them personally, minus anything routed to a different number.
   Not tagged means no restriction, a Nelos admin always sees everything,
   and so does anyone tagged to an HQ system (nelos_modules.sees_all_cases
   — Nursery Operation by default). Re-implemented here rather than imported for the same
   reason as the query above; shared_nelos.js scope() is the authority on
   the rule, so keep the two in step.

   Everything fails SOFT, exactly like the To-Do widget: no session, no
   table, no network, migration not run — the dock removes itself and
   the host page never notices. A floating button is not allowed to
   break a dashboard.

     1600px, JPEG, which is far more than enough to see a pest, a gap or
     a broken bag, and turns eight megabytes into a few hundred kilobytes.
