   PALMS — Plot Activity Log Monitoring System, for the office
   shared/shared_palms.js

   PALMS is recorded in the field, in the FC Portal. The plot log now
   reaches the server (fcportal_palms_plot_logs — see
   create_palms_tables.sql), which is what lets the office read it at
   all: the monitoring board and the motion study live here, in Nursery
   Operation Management, rather than on a Field Conductor's phone.

   This file is the reading of that log. The Field Conductor's app is
   where the same rules were written first — cyclesOf, daysForActivity
   and the span measurements are ported from its motion.js, and the
   activity list and status rules from its data.js. Those are the
   source; if a rule changes there it has to change here, and the
   comments below say WHY each one is the way it is so the two do not
   quietly drift into different answers.

   Nothing here writes. The office reads the field's record; it does not
   correct it.
