   PLOT MOVEMENT — the one place that answers "how many were standing on
   plot X, batch Y, on date Z?"

   The Nursery Movement Report, the Work Maintenance record list and the
   Payroll salary claim all quote that number. They used to work it out
   separately, and the payroll one did not work it out at all — it read the
   keyed qty and showed a dash when there was none, so every worker earned
   RM 0.00 on a plot the maintenance sheet had ticked.

   One module, one answer. Load it once per page:

       await PlotMovement.load(_supabase);
       PlotMovement.recQty(record).value

  /* What is actually standing, from one batch's movements up to a date.

     The 3rd culling count is cumulative: it is keyed against the ORIGINAL
     transplanted figure, not against what was left, so it already contains the
     2nd culling. Subtracting both takes the 2nd culling off twice — which is
     why B1's batch 237 read -2 when 1,182 transplanted less 90 culled, 989 sold
     and 103 transferred away comes to exactly nought.

     So the 2nd culling counts only while no 3rd culling has been recorded yet.
     Before the 3rd, it is the live deduction; after it, it is already inside
     the figure that replaced it.

     This is the STANDING count, and it is not what a maintenance work record
     is worth — see plotCapacity below. It stays because it is what the
     Movement Report quotes, and anything comparing itself to that report has
     to be able to ask for the same number. */

  /* ── WHAT A PLOT IS WORTH TO MAINTAIN ──────────────────────────────────

     Not the standing count. A worker sprays, weeds or manures the seedlings
     that are IN the plot; what happens to them afterwards is not their
     business and must not change what they are paid for the morning.

     Two figures, and only two:

       the plot's transplanted quantity — everything that arrived in this
       plot and batch — and,

       ONCE A 2ND CULLING HAS BEEN RECORDED, the balance it left behind:
       that quantity less what the 2nd culling took. Which is exactly the
       "Alive" the 2nd Culling tab counts and writes into its own remark
       (`Alive: N, Dead: M ... Transplanted: T`, saveTab5 in
       operation_batch_detail.html), derived here from the ledger rather
       than parsed out of the text so a row saved before that wording still
       answers.

     AS AT THE WORK DATE, like everything else here: a 2nd culling dated
     after the morning being claimed had not happened yet, so the plot was
     still carrying the full transplanted quantity that day.

     WHAT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT REDUCE IT:

       the 3rd culling — a plot 3rd-culled at the end of the month was
       maintained all month, and the 3rd culling figure is cumulative
       against the original transplanted quantity anyway, so subtracting it
       routinely drove plots to nought and paid nobody;

       sales — a plot sold down on the 28th still had to be sprayed on the
       4th;

       transfers — they move seedlings between plots of the same batch, so
       they count on both sides: a plot filled entirely by a transfer (the
       -R plots are) has a capacity, and a plot that sent its seedlings
       away no longer carries them.

     Seed damage takes no part: it is recorded against the batch with no
     plot at all, so it never reaches a plot's figure to begin with. */
